# R/A/B/C Lanczos Fixtures

The TensorContraction bridge can capture one real two-site DMRG effective-Hamiltonian solve and replay it without the
surrounding MPS sweep, SVD, or environment update. This is intended for benchmarking the resident R/A/B/C contraction
path and block placement policies.

## Capture

Set `UNI20_RABC_DUMP_PATH` while running `spin_half_heisenberg_u1_dmrg`. The dump hook runs after the strict U(1)
block-sparse MPS/MPO path has built the legal TensorContraction worklist, then writes the static `A` and `C`
environments, active `B` input vector, output block shapes, and `F` terms.

Useful selectors:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `UNI20_RABC_DUMP_PATH` | Output binary fixture path. Enables capture. |
| `UNI20_RABC_DUMP_LEFT_SITE` | Optional two-site left index filter. |
| `UNI20_RABC_DUMP_MIN_BOND_DIM` | Optional minimum left and right external bond dimension. |
| `UNI20_RABC_DUMP_MATCH_INDEX` | Optional zero-based index among matching solves. |

Example central `m=2048` capture:

```bash
env HWLOC_HIDE_ERRORS=2 \
  UNI20_HEISENBERG_LENGTH=40 \
  UNI20_HEISENBERG_MAX_RANK=2048 \
  UNI20_HEISENBERG_SWEEPS=7 \
  UNI20_RABC_DUMP_PATH=/tmp/uni20_l40_m2048_central.rabc \
  UNI20_RABC_DUMP_LEFT_SITE=19 \
  UNI20_RABC_DUMP_MIN_BOND_DIM=2048 \
  UNI20_RABC_DUMP_MATCH_INDEX=0 \
  ./build_codex/tensorcontraction-polaron-release-fresh/examples/spin_half_heisenberg_u1_dmrg
```

The fixture is a compact local binary format. It is not intended as a portable archival wavefunction format.

## Replay

Replay the fixture with a fixed Lanczos iteration count:

```bash
env HWLOC_HIDE_ERRORS=2 \
  UNI20_RABC_LANCZOS_ITERS=24 \
  UNI20_RABC_LANCZOS_MIN_ITERS=24 \
  MP_BENCHFILE=/tmp/uni20_rabc_replay.bench \
  ./build_codex/tensorcontraction-polaron-release-fresh/examples/tensorcontraction_rabc_lanczos_benchmark \
  /tmp/uni20_l40_m2048_central.rabc
```

The replay benchmark uploads the captured initial vector once, keeps host synchronization disabled, and resets each
repeat with resident vector algebra. `UNI20_TENSORCONTRACTION_DEVICES=all` exercises one-process multi-GPU placement;
`mpirun -np 2` with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$OMPI_COMM_WORLD_LOCAL_RANK` exercises one GPU per MPI rank.

The fixture preserves the exact TensorContraction block worklist emitted by the symmetry-aware DMRG path, but it does
not store the higher-level `LocalSpace`, `BlockSpace`, or MPO metadata. Do not feed fixture data back into U(1) MPS
state; use it only as a terminal benchmark artifact.
